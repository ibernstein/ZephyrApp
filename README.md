# ZephyrApp

This Repo contains the code for a possible framework for the Zephyr iOS app. Zephyr was a company in its infancy stages created by friends in the business school at Wash U in the Fall of 2016. 

This version was a colaboration between Ian Bernstein (myself), Tony Bumatay, and Hannah Mehrle, completed for the final project of our Mobile App Development course at Wash U (Fall 2016). 

Utilizes: Swift 3, Xcode 7, Firebase, Facebook Login SDK
